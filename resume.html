    <p>
        In august of 2018 I partook in a summer camp held at And√∏ya Space Center where
        me and many other participants from all around the world worked together to
        build sensors that we placed inside a rocket such that we could analyze atmospheric
        data when we launched it. We also got to attend lectures held by prominent scientists
        and even got to hold an old piece of the hubble space telescope.

        During high school in 2020 I competed in a physics olympiad in which I managed to
        pass the first two rounds and went on to represent my county in the capital, unfortunately
        the olympiad was cancelled due to covid-19, so I was never able to attend the third round,
        nor represent norway internationally were I to pass the third round. I did get a diploma for
        my achievemen however.
